# ASL-Recognition

The aim to implement a developed recognition system of American sign language (ASL)specifically for
digits within a deep learning model interprets the competence of developing a neural network
incorporating various methods learnt throughout the course of this module.
Throughout this study, we were able to develop both a baseline CNN model, and an accurate based CNN
model that includes various features and methods to enhance accuracy of predicting datasets. The choice
of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is necessary as the dataset provided consists of categories of
digits (1-10) and conditions that may aid or complicate predictability â€“ such as lighting, distance,
unambiguous gesturing, colour, etc.
The results gained from both models displays noticeable accuracy and loss differences across all training,
validation and testing datasets. These results are then compared to third party results from external
studies that performed the same objective of recognising ASL using a CNN architecture. The primary
difference between this study and other studies, are the datasets used are unidentical. Nevertheless, a
substantial resulting of accuracy and loss is imminent for the models despite the difference in conditions
and volumes of the datasets.
